Some notes about numerical algorithm.

## Numerical stable


### Round-off error

An example show how to calculate pi by LiuHui method.
The basic idea is, from a hexagon, with radius 1, all 6 edge length 1, split an edge by a ray from centre O through midpoint of the edge, caculate length of two new chords.
Repeat until the new chords are small enough, therefore, the regular polygon will converge to a circle with same radius.

### Cholesky decomposition (hmmlearn)
